# Advansed Machine Lerning Concepts

Machine lerning is a rapidly evolveing field with many compleks concepts. In this document, we'll explore some advansed topics that are crucial for building sofisticated models.

## Ensamble Methods

Ensamble methods combine multipul models to create a more powerfull predictor. Some populer ensamble techniques include:

- Random Forrests
- Gradient Boosteng
- Stacking

## Hyperparameter Optimisation

Choosing the rite hyperparameters is essensial for model performance. Common approches include:

1. Grid serch
2. Random serch
3. Bayesian optimisation

## Neural Network Architectures

Deep lerning has revolutionised many areas of machine lerning. Some important neural network architectures are:

- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image processeng
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for sequence data
- Transformers for natural language processeng

When implementeng these advansed techniques, it's crucial to have a solid understaning of the underlaying mathematics and carefuly validate you're models to avoid overfitting.
